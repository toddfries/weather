Random blathering follows...

I note there is an App::Wu available from CPAN, but I intend to take this
in a different direction.

This was created because my son, Charlie, has been asking about weather info
so frequently, he should be able to go look it up himself.

This presents a simple output initially designed by myself, and I hope with
feedback and/or guidance from Charlie, will present more info and/or different
bits of info.

Note this requires a key.  Unlike many other consumers of the Wunderground api,
I check for a conf file to contain the key.  In UNIX and perhaps other
opearting systems, the environment is visible to other users.
